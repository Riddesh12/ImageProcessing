🖼️ Image Processing Application
📄 Overview
This project is an Image Processing Application developed using Python, leveraging the NumPy and PIL (Python Imaging Library)
libraries. It enables users to perform basic image processing operations like color inversion, grayscale conversion, 
and brightness adjustment. The application reads an image, processes it, and saves the resulting images efficiently.

🚀 Features
✅ Read and process images of various formats
✅ Perform operations like:

Color Inversion
Grayscale Conversion
Brightness Adjustment
✅ Save processed images with minimal quality loss
✅ Modular and easy-to-understand code structure
🏗️ System Architecture
Input Module: Reads and converts images into NumPy arrays.
Processing Module: Performs selected image processing operations.
Output Module: Converts arrays back to images and saves them.
User Interface (CLI): Simple command-line interface for user interaction.
